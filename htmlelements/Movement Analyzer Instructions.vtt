00:00:03.085 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Instructor>This is just a quick video</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.440
to show you exactly what you would be doing

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.450
with this project.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.530
So to start out, you definitely might want to make sure

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.410
that you have the option.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.560
I think within Windows you can go under internet options

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.863
and just make sure that,

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.160
when you click on a link,

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.790
a browser will pop up.

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.397
Otherwise, I mean, if it doesn't happen

11
00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:34.830
and you don't wanna set up, that's totally cool,

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.780
but it's one of the things where your copy

13
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.110
and paste situation may be a little

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.603
in the way or anything,

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.480
or you can just keep one,

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.210
open one email browser and put that in,

17
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.043
paste everything in.

18
00:00:58.043 --> 00:00:59.610
That's completely up to you,

19
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.893
but for this project,

20
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.970
you are basically going to track actions,

21
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.500
and so to start out,

22
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500
I would actually send you a Excel file

23
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.300
of YouTube videos,

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.390
and you will see quotation marks around these.

25
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.260
These do need to stay in when you paste the video,

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.320
and so you'll just come here to this little URL link.

27
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.233
You'll paste it, and you will click start,

28
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.510
and then your video will appear.

29
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.510
Now, so here exactly is what's going to happen.

30
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
So every time you start a video,

31
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.480
which will simply be where you press play on here,

32
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.153
you will need to click NEW CONNECTION,

33
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.940
and basically, what will happen is you will be analyzing

34
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.240
each single person's actions and reactions.

35
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.353
Now, you are going to monitor one person at a time,

36
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.470
and when you are done,

37
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.430
if they are interacting with another person or more people,

38
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.430
then you will click a new analysis,

39
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.540
and then you will analyze that new person,

40
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.373
and then when you're done,

41
00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:26.043
you'll click NEW ANANAL, NEW ANA, NEW ANAALIS,

42
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.630
that one (chuckling), and you'll just keep doing that

43
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.770
until you've monitored all the actions and reactions,

44
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.193
and so, yeah,

45
00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:43.980
and once you're done with a particular group of reactions,

46
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.050
then you'll just click NEW CONNECTION,

47
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.610
and then you can, of course,

48
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.710
if there's another group interacting

49
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.840
on the other side of the video,

50
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.880
then, of course, you can back up all the way.

51
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.377
You can do a NEW CONNECTION there and so on and so forth,

52
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.013
and so ideally, what will happen is I will make sure,

53
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.690
the first week, just kind of monitor things,

54
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.980
see how it's going, but in the first week,

55
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.920
I mean, it'll be just kind of like a freebie,

56
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.870
but then like the weeks following that,

57
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.770
what will probably happen is I'll probably monitor,

58
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.490
or I'll probably do analysis of one or two videos

59
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.420
that you have done,

60
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.310
just to make sure we're on the right track.

61
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.310
and typically, I'll probably set about a 75% similar rate

62
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.480
and then give you, I don't know,

63
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.210
maybe five or six times to meet that

64
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.460
to classify yourself as an expert,

65
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.670
and so, yeah,

66
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.670
and so we are going to get started just as an example.

67
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.143
So for this one,

68
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.560
here, that's one of the things, or some of the videos like,

69
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.850
and also, just so you know,

70
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.610
we only monitor human interaction.

71
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.330
Basically, if you see a car driving down the road,

72
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.960
and it crashes, but people never get out,

73
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.910
or you cannot actually see their faces

74
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.030
and their interactions through the window or anything,

75
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.400
don't monitor that action.

76
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.290
However, if you see a crash,

77
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.443
and then you see people running to the cars to help,

78
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.860
analyze the crash, and to do that,

79
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.700
you will do MECHANICAL OPERATION, then MATERIAL DAMAGE,

80
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.700
and then, yeah, you will continue on from there,

81
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.660
and I will also take some time to explain

82
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.270
each of these and kind of what it means,

83
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.353
but yeah, so let's go ahead and just do one as an example.

84
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.933
Let's just watch some people.

85
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.343
Do do do.

86
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.650
Let's just skip through this.

87
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.950
Of course, you never would

88
00:05:25.413 --> 00:05:30.413
'cause I would be paying you just to do stuff or, you know.

89
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.240
So we're just gonna monitor that person (indistinct),

90
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.253
and they are walking.

91
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.043
Oh, actually, let me do this 'cause I made a mistake,

92
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.770
and so if I click on NEW CONNECTION,

93
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.770
and then sometimes it can be a minute or two,

94
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.650
click NEW CONNECTION again right before you monitor some,

95
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.690
and so we'll do that person,

96
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.293
and so actually, here, let's back up a little here,

97
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.330
and yeah, so it's kind of like this.

98
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.090
It's been a week or, or a couple minutes or so

99
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.260
until you click NEW CONNECTION.

100
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.300
So we're actually just gonna monitor that person.

101
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.463
So we're gonna do walk,

102
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.250
and that's it,

103
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.280
and so you did NEW CONNECTION, and you're done,

104
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.280
and so lemme go ahead and do another one,

105
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.813
or we might have a pair of people interacting.

106
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.090
Here we go.

107
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.150
So you see these three people here.

108
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.620
We're gonna monitor one at a time.

109
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.270
We're gonna do NEW CONNECTION.

110
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.363
We're gonna do walking,

111
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.243
and we're gonna backtrack.

112
00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.700
Actually, we're just gonna...

113
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.077
Okay, we're gonna do NEW CONNECTION,

114
00:07:01.077 --> 00:07:03.390
and so that person walked.

115
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.163
That person turned,

116
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and that person walked and tur-

117
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.753
Oh, excuse me, they inserted themselves.

118
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.203
Yes, and so that's it for that,

119
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.343
and ideally, what will happen is, as time goes on,

120
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.510
you will actually get pretty good at this

121
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.550
to where you can kind of do it

122
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.600
momentarily (fingers snapping)

123
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.430
'cause basically the main situation

124
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.710
is memorizing where all these are at

125
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.500
and what exactly button you wanna press down here,

126
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.673
and ideally, you will want a mouse,

127
00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.240
but I mean, your mousepad works well.

128
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.790
It's just it's easier to have a mouse

129
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.070
that you can quickly maneuver with your hand,

130
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.327
and so (indistinct).

131
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.045
All right, so I'm actually gonna look for a group.

132
00:08:15.045 --> 00:08:16.830
Oh wait, no, we did that.

133
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.393
Okay, so gonna see here.

134
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.260
You're gonna see that we did that.

135
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.793
We already monitored him, so we're okay there, and then,

136
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.190
okay, so let's actually monitor these people

137
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.213
on the bridge here,

138
00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:57.180
or actually, let's monitor these people walking.

139
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.343
So ideally, what will happen,

140
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.232
or actually, we can monitor them.

141
00:09:04.232 --> 00:09:06.933
Okay, so you saw that woman.

142
00:09:09.485 --> 00:09:11.735
(scoffing)

143
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.783
Okay, so,

144
00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:19.859
you're gonna see these people.

145
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.950
We're gonna monitor this person first.

146
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.493
They're going to WALK, TURN,

147
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.893
TWIST/TURN, VERBAL SPEECH,

148
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.570
and then we are going to...

149
00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:44.970
Okay, then we're gonna do a NEW ANALYSIS,

150
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.580
and I chose the NEW CONNECTION before that,

151
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.420
and then we're gonna do this person who's just walking

152
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.243
and talking, and we're gonna do a NEW ANALYSIS,

153
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.130
and we're gonna do

154
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.100
this person who is

155
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.250
walking and reading

156
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.410
'cause she's reading her phone,

157
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.810
and she's also doing MECHANICAL OPERATION,

158
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.280
which I will explain later,

159
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.343
and we're gonna do a NEW ANALYSIS,

160
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.770
and we're gonna go back

161
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.730
and do that person, which is walking, showing affection,

162
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.340
and they kind of looked over to ANALYZE.

163
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.540
So we're gonna do that.

164
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.403
We're gonna do the last person,

165
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.563
I think, (grunting)

166
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.723
and this person is walking,

167
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.647
analyzing, and you type in NEW CONNECTION,

168
00:11:07.647 --> 00:11:09.120
and we're going from there.

169
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.440
So I mean, so I actually just created this about a week ago.

170
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.510
So of course, I'm still getting kind of used to it,

171
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.600
but ideally, what will happen is,

172
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.010
once you get used to everything,

173
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.770
you'll do it in real time, eh-

174
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.870
Excuse me, you'll know exactly what to do,

175
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.360
but yeah, okay, so once you are,

176
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.370
I mean, not necessarily done with the video,

177
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.370
but maybe after about

178
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.560
maybe 30 minutes' worth of doing a video,

179
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.643
you'll come up here,

180
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.080
and you'll click ORGANIZE DATA, VIEW ENTRIES,

181
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.730
which you'll actually not see anything.

182
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.980
You'll do COPY TO CLIPBOARD,

183
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.870
and then, you will click this link

184
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.750
or make sure you send your information

185
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.840
to info@petersinnovations.com.

186
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.453
You will just simply copy, paste that.

187
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.700
You can type in data,

188
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.700
and if this is your first time sending it

189
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.050
with your email address,

190
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.583
you'll type in your name,

191
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.070
and then yeah, just keep on sending that data,

192
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.530
and you are good to go,

193
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:29.523
and so yeah, so let's kind of discuss some of things.

194
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.350
AEROBIC CARDIO EXERCISE is basically you just doing movement

195
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.540
but not necessarily having any intention to achieve a goal.

196
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.220
If you run to save a kid's life,

197
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.950
this is not CARDIO EXERCISE.

198
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.280
This is actually just going to be a different one called RUN

199
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.840
'cause it kind of runs with the person.

200
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.270
AFFECTIONATE, HUGS, KISSES,

201
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.500
anything that basically is intended to show the person

202
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.500
that they are admired in a physical manner.

203
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.700
AGREEMENT, basically, these are just head nods or yeah.

204
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.080
ANALYZE, basically these are when people look around,

205
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.660
but they're not just necessarily looking around.

206
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.570
They're just kind of looking around at specific something,

207
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.953
or they're doing calculations or something of the sort.

208
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.950
ANGRY MOVEMENTS, fist movements,

209
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.570
flipping people off, et cetera, et cetera.

210
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.623
ANNOY, INSULT, these are basically when people try to annoy,

211
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.590
or basically, (coughing) you can kind of tell

212
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.580
that their actions are intended to not necessarily bring out

213
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.050
the best in others.

214
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.450
ARRIVE, they simply arrive,

215
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.480
and this could have also been an option

216
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.970
when the person walked into the door.

217
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.050
BALANCE, basically, this is

218
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.403
any time they try to even things out.

219
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.170
This is can include dividing groups in halves

220
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.653
or just trying to balance on a measure or something.

221
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.993
BEND, any time they bend over, they kneel,

222
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.970
anything of the sort.

223
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.700
BLEED, that's kind of obvious.

224
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.710
BITE, anything.

225
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.430
CARRY, yeah, this is very self-explanatory.

226
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.160
CHALLENGE, basically, this is the time when people

227
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.230
are...

228
00:14:33.218 --> 00:14:35.160
(sighing)

229
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.020
Actually, I'm gonna kind of stop right there

230
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.900
'cause this might be a long, long video if I do this,

231
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.370
and so (chuckling) I'm sorry.

232
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.200
So I'm actually just going to stop here,

233
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.810
and if we decide to move forward together,

234
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.750
that's when I'll explain exactly when should use

235
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.220
all of these verbs, so but yeah, this is the video.

236
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.960
If you'd like to apply, that'd be awesome.

237
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.980
All right, thank you so much.

238
00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.830
Have a great day.
